# 1. Hobo meta information

To compare localized air temperature measurements with those recorded at weather stations, HOBO Pendant temperature/light data loggers were deployed in the Ecosense Forest in Ettenheim, Germany (Fig. 1) and compared with two local stations. The logger was placed 2m above the ground, secured within a spruce tree and shielded from light using an opaque container, open at the bottom (Fig. 2). Nestled close to the trunk of the young tree, the logger was largely protected from wind, which could otherwise affect the *5-minute* temperature readings. However, the string securing the logger’s container to the branch might have allowed movement in strong winds, potentially introducing variability in measurements taken. Additionally, while the container was mostly opaque, prolonged sunlight could still slightly warm it, adding an additional influencing factor. This effect is likely minimal given the measurement period (October–December), when sunlight is weaker, daylight hours are shorter, and the logger's north-easterly placement on the tree's shaded side reduced sun exposure.

# 2. Consistent HOBO data file

           to = ymd_hm('2025.12.25 23:50'),
           by = '10 mins')


hrs = seq(ymd_hm('2024.10.30 00:00'),
          ymd_hm('2024.10.30 00:00'),
          by = '1 hour')
